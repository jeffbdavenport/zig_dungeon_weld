struct definitions:
  Game - Allows binary to run both client and server code based on argument
  Timesync - Sleep for a very specific amount of time in a loop
  SpriteSheet - Container that holds all sprite Tiles:
    Tile - a single sprite cut out of a SpriteSheet:
      Coord - A point in the world
      Coords - Diagnal points that make a square
  display:
    Background - Uses single Tile with a Geometry to add that tile to every position on the screen to make up a full background based on render size
    Geometry - Containes tiles and their order and positions to be printed to a screen frame
    Renderer - Contains all logic for printing the game screen using Geometry textures
    Window - Containes SDL Renderer and Window - calculating Render size from Window size as well as main game loop run()
  devices:
    Keyboard - Captures named keybinding keys down and pressed
  world:
    PhysicsProcess - Any logic related to physics, including main physics loop

  main - global one line function declarations
  mod.zig - const definitions for file structs
